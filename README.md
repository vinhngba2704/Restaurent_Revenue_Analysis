Analysis and Predict Restaurent's revenue based on list of conditions

# About Problem
Currently, choosing new restaurant locations relies heavily on the gut
feeling of development teams, making it inconsistent across different
regions and cultures. This subjective approach is risky, as opening 
a restaurant in the wrong spot can lead to closure within a year and 
a half, wasting significant time and money. To improve investment efficiency
and free up resources for other areas, a mathematical model that predicts
restaurant sales based on various data points is needed.
This analysis article  aims to develop such a model by using data on 
demographics, real estate, and commerce to predict annual sales for 
100,000 potential locations.
